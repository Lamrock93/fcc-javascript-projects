## Free Code Camp Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

These are my projects for Free Code Camp's JavaScript algorithms and data structures certification. These demonstrate my knowledge of the JavaScript syntax and data structures, as well as my problem solving abilities.

### Projects
#### Caesar's Cipher
This project takes a string, and shifts all letters (case insensitive) forward 13 places in the alphabet, leaving the rest of the characters unchanged. It returns the "decoded" string.

#### Cash Register
This project simulates what happens in a till following a cash transaction, based on the contents of the cash register at the time, the price of the item, and the amount of cash given as payment. It checks if exact change can be given based on the contents of the register and the payment minus the price, and if so returns the exact change given back as an array.

#### Palindrome Checker
This project takes a string, filters out everything but the letter and number characters, and checks if it is the same when read forwards and backwards. If it is, it returns true, and if not it returns false.

#### Roman Numeral Converter
This project takes an integer, and working from largest numeral to smallest, generates a string representing its roman numeral value. The number updates by subtracting the amount that each roman numeral character added represents, running until the entire number is accounted for. This program supports subtractive notation (IV, IX, XL, etc.)

#### Telephone Number Validator
This project takes a string, and performs a series of tests and manipulations on it to see if qualifies valid telephone number. It heavily utilizes regular expressions and string manipulation methods to do so, returning false if it fails a test, and true if it unequivocally qualifies.
